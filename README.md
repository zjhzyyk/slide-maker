slide maker
===========

This is a slide maker by Javascript and CSS.

[Here is a live demo](http://www.prism.gatech.edu/~yyang367/slide-maker)

The idea is to give the outline in the screen. Slides can be added under each subtitle. Clicking on slide will zoom to that slide and you will be able to edit it. All editing is inline which means what you see is what you get. 

The sample presentation below may give you a better idea about what this application is doing.
